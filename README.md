## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free  .
- Background of this project : A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- The problem statment we are trying to solve is to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Dataset provided for this project contains details of season, weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed and on what day the bike was rented.



## Conclusions
Following are the interpretations from the mulitple linear regression model built 
1. In the data we had demand for year of 2018 and 2019 and by this, we were able to see the increase in demand for year 2019 
2. Demand will be high during the working days and demand goes down during holidays 
3. Demand will be high whenever there is an increase in temperature
4. During seasons of summer and winter, demand will be higher and demand goes down during spring season
5. Demand goes down during higher windspeed
6. In terms of months, september will have higher demand and july will have lower demand 
7. During moderate weather, demand goes down
